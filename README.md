The Problem 

Assembly solves the problem of connecting and finding other players to play games with. Many gamers have trouble finding people to play with. As time goes on the gaming experience has reportedly taken a hit and gamers have reported a loss in satisfaction from playing games. This is due to some gamers not having friends to play with or having friends but none that share the same interest in games as them.
Assembly provides a solution by allowing users to connect with other gamers who have similar gaming interests and bring them together to play. It also can help players to find new friends who also love the same games, which will help to increase their gaming experience and fun.



Solution
Assembly offers a way for gamers to connect with one another and find other players to play games with. Users can create an account, select their favorite games, add friends, and communicate with one another. They can also make posts in search of other players to play with and react to posts to express interest in playing with other users. This provides a way for gamers to find and connect with others who have similar interests and makes it easy to find people to play with. This could help to increase their gaming experience and satisfaction.

Key Technical Challenges
A key technical challenge would be implementing authentication like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth for handling user authentication and authorization and implementing real-time communication like WebSockets or Firebase for building real-time messaging and notifications. 


Extension Opportunities 

Adding comments or react buttons to a user's post, as well as letting others see and buy games for a friend, would be an extension opportunity. Implementing a notification feature to know when someone interacts with your post, Another opportunity would be to implement a block button if a user doesn't want to talk to other people. Some added features would be tags displaying what the user is looking for like adults to play with, people with mics, experienced players or just casual players and adding dates to display when the time of the post will be active, such as now, tomorrow, next week or next month.
Some extra features would also be adding how many players are needed in the post such as 2 , 3 or 4 players needed and this could go with any type of game. Add date to when game was posted.
